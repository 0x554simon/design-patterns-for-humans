🎉 对设计模式的极简说明！🎉
</p>
<p align="center">
这个话题可以轻易让任何人糊涂。现在我尝试通过用<i>最简单</i>的方式说明它们，来让你（和我）牢记在心。
</p>
***

🚀 简介
=================

设计模式用来解决重复的问题；**是解决特定问题的指导方针**。它们不是类(class)，包(packages)，或者库(libraries)，你不能引入它们，然后等待奇迹发生。它们是针对解决特定环境下特定问题的指导方针。

> 设计模式用来解决重复的问题；是解决特定问题的指导方针

维基百科的解释

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

⚠️ 请注意
-----------------
- 设计模式不是解决你所有问题的银弹。
- 不要尝试强行使用它们；如果做了，不好的事情可能发生。请记住设计模式是**解决**问题的方案，不是**发现**问题；所以不要过度思考。
- 如果在正确的地方以正确的方式使用，它们被证明是有帮助的；否则结果可能是一对可怕混乱的代码。

> 下面的代码示例使用 PHP-7 书写，但你不应止步于此，因为理念是相通的。再加上,**s对其他语言的支持正在路上**。

设计模式的种类

* [创建型](#creational-design-patterns)
* [结构型](#structural-design-patterns)
* [行为型](#behavioral-design-patterns)

创建型模式
==========================

白话
> 创建型模式侧重如何实例化一个对象或一组相关对象。

维基百科
> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

🏠 简单工厂模式
--------------
真实世界例子
> 假设，你正在建造一所房子，你需要门。如果每次你需要一扇门你都要穿上木工服开始在房子里造扇门，将会是一团乱。取而代之的是让工厂造好。

白话
> 简单工厂模式在不暴露生成逻辑的前提下生成一个实例。

维基百科
> 在面向对象编程(OOP)中，一个工厂是一个创建其他对象的对象 —— 一个工厂是一个函数或方法，被调用后返回特定原型或类的对象。调用方式通常是“new”。

**代码例子**

首先，我们有一个门的接口和实现
```php
interface Door {
    public function getWidth() : float;
    public function getHeight() : float;
}

class WoodenDoor implements Door {
    protected $width;
    protected $height;

    public function __construct(float $width, float $height) {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }
    
    public function getWidth() : float {
        return $this->width;
    }
    
    public function getHeight() : float {
        return $this->height;
    }
}
```
然后，我们有了工厂来制造和返回门
```php
class DoorFactory {
   public static function makeDoor($width, $height) : Door {
       return new WoodenDoor($width, $height);
   }
}
```
然后这样使用
```php
$door = DoorFactory::makeDoor(100, 200);
echo 'Width: ' . $door->getWidth();
echo 'Height: ' . $door->getHeight();
```

**什么时候使用？**

当创建一个对象不只是几个赋值和逻辑计算，把这件工作交给一个工厂而不是到处重复相同的代码就比较重要了。

🏭 工厂方法模式
--------------

真实世界例子
> 设想一个人事经理。一个人是不可能面试所有职位的。基于职位空缺，她必须把面试委托给不同的人。

白话
> 它提供了一个把生成逻辑移交给子类的方法。

维基百科
> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.
 
 **代码例子**
 
以上面的人事经理为例。首先我们有一个面试官接口和一些实现

```php
interface Interviewer {
    public function askQuestions();
}

class Developer implements Interviewer {
    public function askQuestions() {
        echo 'Asking about design patterns!';
    }
}

class CommunityExecutive implements Interviewer {
    public function askQuestions() {
        echo 'Asking about community building';
    }
}
```

现在我们新建我们的人事经理 `HiringManager`

```php
abstract class HiringManager {
    
    // Factory method
    abstract public function makeInterviewer() : Interviewer;
    
    public function takeInterview() {
        $interviewer = $this->makeInterviewer();
        $interviewer->askQuestions();
    }
}
```
现在任何一个都可以继承它，并且生成需要的面试官
```php
class DevelopmentManager extends HiringManager {
    public function makeInterviewer() : Interviewer {
        return new Developer();
    }
}

class MarketingManager extends HiringManager {
    public function makeInterviewer() : Interviewer {
        return new CommunityExecutive();
    }
}
```
然后可以这样使用

```php
$devManager = new DevelopmentManager();
$devManager->takeInterview(); // Output: Asking about design patterns

$marketingManager = new MarketingManager();
$marketingManager->takeInterview(); // Output: Asking about community building.
```

**何时使用？**

当一个类里有普遍性的处理过程，但是子类要在运行时才确定的时候。或者换句话说，调用者不知道它需要哪个子类。

🔨 抽象工厂模式
----------------

真实世界例子
> 扩展我们简单工厂模式的例子。基于你的需求，你可以从木门店得到一扇木门，从铁门店得到一扇铁门，或者从塑料门店得到一扇塑料门。而且你需要一个有不同专长的人来安装这扇门，比如一个木匠来安木门，焊工来安铁门等。正如你看的，门和安装工有依赖性，木门需要木匠，铁门需要焊工等。

白话
> 一个制造工厂的工厂；一个工厂把独立但是相关／有依赖性的工厂进行分类，但是不需要给出具体的类。
  
维基百科
> The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes

**代码例子**

翻译上面门的例子。首先我们有了门 `Door` 的接口和一些实现

```php
interface Door {
    public function getDescription();
}

class WoodenDoor implements Door {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I am a wooden door';
    }
}

class IronDoor implements Door {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I am an iron door';
    }
}
```
然后我们有了每种门的安装专家

```php
interface DoorFittingExpert {
    public function getDescription();
}

class Welder implements DoorFittingExpert {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I can only fit iron doors';
    }
}

class Carpenter implements DoorFittingExpert {
    public function getDescription() {
        echo 'I can only fit wooden doors';
    }
}
```

现在我们有了抽象工厂来创建全部相关的对象，即木门工厂制造木门和木门安装专家，铁门工厂制造铁门和铁门安装专家
```php
interface DoorFactory {
    public function makeDoor() : Door;
    public function makeFittingExpert() : DoorFittingExpert;
}

// Wooden factory to return carpenter and wooden door
class WoodenDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
    public function makeDoor() : Door {
        return new WoodenDoor();
    }

    public function makeFittingExpert() : DoorFittingExpert{
        return new Carpenter();
    }
}

// Iron door factory to get iron door and the relevant fitting expert
class IronDoorFactory implements DoorFactory {
    public function makeDoor() : Door {
        return new IronDoor();
    }

    public function makeFittingExpert() : DoorFittingExpert{
        return new Welder();
    }
}
```
然后可以这样使用
```php
$woodenFactory = new WoodenDoorFactory();

$door = $woodenFactory->makeDoor();
$expert = $woodenFactory->makeFittingExpert();

$door->getDescription();  // Output: I am a wooden door
$expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit wooden doors

// Same for Iron Factory
$ironFactory = new IronDoorFactory();

$door = $ironFactory->makeDoor();
$expert = $ironFactory->makeFittingExpert();

$door->getDescription();  // Output: I am an iron door
$expert->getDescription(); // Output: I can only fit iron doors
```

如你所见，木门工厂包含了木匠 `carpenter` 和木门 `wooden door` 而铁门工厂包含了铁门 `iron door` 和焊工 `welder`。因此我们可以确保每扇制造出来的门不会带上错误的安装工。

**何时使用？**

当创建逻辑不那么简单，而且相互之间有依赖时

👷 建造者模式
--------------------------------------------
真实世界例子
> 想象你在麦当劳，你要一个“巨无霸”，他们马上就给你了，没有疑问，这是简单工厂的逻辑。但如果创建逻辑包含更多步骤。比如你想要一个自定义赛百味套餐，你有多种选择来制作汉堡，例如你要哪种面包？你要哪种调味酱？你要哪种奶酪？等。这种情况就需要建造者模式来处理。

白话
> 让你能创建不同特点的对象而避免构造函数污染。当一个对象都多种特点的时候比较实用。或者在创造逻辑里有许多步骤的时候。
 
维基百科
> The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern with the intentions of finding a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.

话虽如此，让我写一点关于伸缩构造函数反面模式。在某些时候，我们都看过下面这样的构造函数
 
```php
public function __construct($size, $cheese = true, $pepperoni = true, $tomato = false, $lettuce = true) {
}
```

如你所见；构造函数参数的数量马上就要失去控制，而且梳理参数也会变得困难。而且如果你将来想要增加更多选项，参数也会继续增加。这就叫做伸缩构造函数反面模式。

**代码例子**

正常的做法是使用创建者模式。首先我们有了要做的汉堡

```php
class Burger {
    protected $size;

    protected $cheese = false;
    protected $pepperoni = false;
    protected $lettuce = false;
    protected $tomato = false;
    
    public function __construct(BurgerBuilder $builder) {
        $this->size = $builder->size;
        $this->cheese = $builder->cheese;
        $this->pepperoni = $builder->pepperoni;
        $this->lettuce = $builder->lettuce;
        $this->tomato = $builder->tomato;
    }
}
```

然后我们有了建造者

```php
class BurgerBuilder {
    public $size;

    public $cheese = false;
    public $pepperoni = false;
    public $lettuce = false;
    public $tomato = false;

    public function __construct(int $size) {
        $this->size = $size;
    }
    
    public function addPepperoni() {
        $this->pepperoni = true;
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function addLettuce() {
        $this->lettuce = true;
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function addCheese() {
        $this->cheese = true;
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function addTomato() {
        $this->tomato = true;
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function build() : Burger {
        return new Burger($this);
    }
}
```
然后可以这样使用

```php
$burger = (new BurgerBuilder(14))
                    ->addPepperoni()
                    ->addLettuce()
                    ->addTomato()
                    ->build();
```

**何时使用？**

当对象有多种特性而要避免构造函数变长。和工厂模式的核心区别是；当创建过程只有一个步骤的时候使用工厂模式，而当创建过程有多个步骤的时候使用创造者模式。

🐑 原型模式
------------
真实世界例子
> 记得多利吗？那只克隆羊！不要在意细节，现在的重点是克隆

白话
> 通过克隆已有的对象来创建新对象。

维基百科
> The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

长话短说，它让你创建已有对象的拷贝，然后修改到你要的样子，而不是从头开始建造。

**代码例子**

在 PHP 里，简单的使用 `clone` 就可以了
  
```php
class Sheep {
    protected $name;
    protected $category;

    public function __construct(string $name, string $category = 'Mountain Sheep') {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->category = $category;
    }
    
    public function setName(string $name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setCategory(string $category) {
        $this->category = $category;
    }

    public function getCategory() {
        return $this->category;
    }
}
```
然后它可以被这样克隆
```php
$original = new Sheep('Jolly');
echo $original->getName(); // Jolly
echo $original->getCategory(); // Mountain Sheep

// Clone and modify what is required
$cloned = clone $original;
$cloned->setName('Dolly');
echo $cloned->getName(); // Dolly
echo $cloned->getCategory(); // Mountain sheep
```

你也可以使用魔法方法 `__clone` 来改变克隆逻辑。

**何时使用？**

当一个对象需要跟已有的对象相似，或者当创造过程比起克隆来太昂贵时。

💍 单例模式
------------
真实世界例子
> 一个国家同一时间只能有一个总统。当使命召唤的时候，这个总统要采取行动。这里的总统就是单例的。

白话
> 确保制定的类只生成一个对象。

维基百科
> In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

单例模式其实被看作一种反面模式，应该避免过度使用。它不一定不好，而且确有一些有效的用例，但是应该谨慎使用，因为它在你的应用里引入了全局状态，在一个地方改变，会影响其他地方。而且很难 debug 。另一个坏处是它让你的代码紧耦合，而且很难仿制单例。

**代码例子**

要创建一个单例，先让构造函数私有，不能克隆，不能继承，然后创造一个静态变量来保存这个实例
```php
final class President {
    private static $instance;

    private function __construct() {
        // Hide the constructor
    }
    
    public static function getInstance() : President {
        if (!self::$instance) {
            self::$instance = new self();
        }
        
        return self::$instance;
    }
    
    private function __clone() {
        // Disable cloning
    }
    
    private function __wakeup() {
        // Disable unserialize
    }
}
```
然后要使用的话
```php
$president1 = President::getInstance();
$president2 = President::getInstance();

var_dump($president1 === $president2); // true
```

结构型模式
==========================
白话
> 结构型模式更关注对象的组合，换句话说，实体如何彼此使用。或者说，它们帮助解答“如何建造软件组件？”

维基百科
> In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

🔌 适配器模式
-------
真实世界例子
> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter.
> Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet.
> Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another

白话
> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class.

维基百科
> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

**代码例子**

Consider a game where there is a hunter and he hunts lions.

First we have an interface `Lion` that all types of lions have to implement

```php
interface Lion {
    public function roar();
}

class AfricanLion implements Lion {
    public function roar() {}
}

class AsianLion implements Lion {
    public function roar() {}
}
```
And hunter expects any implementation of `Lion` interface to hunt.
```php
class Hunter {
    public function hunt(Lion $lion) {
    }
}
```

Now let's say we have to add a `WildDog` in our game so that hunter can hunt that also. But we can't do that directly because dog has a different interface. To make it compatible for our hunter, we will have to create an adapter that is compatible
 
```php
// This needs to be added to the game
class WildDog {
    public function bark() {}
}

// Adapter around wild dog to make it compatible with our game
class WildDogAdapter implements Lion {
    protected $dog;

    public function __construct(WildDog $dog) {
        $this->dog = $dog;
    }
    
    public function roar() {
        $this->dog->bark();
    }
}
```
And now the `WildDog` can be used in our game using `WildDogAdapter`.

```php
$wildDog = new WildDog();
$wildDogAdapter = new WildDogAdapter($wildDog);

$hunter = new Hunter();
$hunter->hunt($wildDogAdapter);
```

🚡 Bridge
------
真实世界例子
> Consider you have a website with different pages and you are supposed to allow the user to change the theme. What would you do? Create multiple copies of each of the pages for each of the themes or would you just create separate theme and load them based on the user's preferences? Bridge pattern allows you to do the second i.e.

![With and without the bridge pattern](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11269635/23065293/33b7aea0-f515-11e6-983f-98823c9845ee.png)

白话
> Bridge pattern is about preferring composition over inheritance. Implementation details are pushed from a hierarchy to another object with a separate hierarchy.

维基百科
> The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently"

**代码例子**

Translating our WebPage example from above. Here we have the `WebPage` hierarchy

```php
interface WebPage {
    public function __construct(Theme $theme);
    public function getContent();
}

class About implements WebPage {
    protected $theme;
    
    public function __construct(Theme $theme) {
        $this->theme = $theme;
    }
    
    public function getContent() {
        return "About page in " . $this->theme->getColor();
    }
}

class Careers implements WebPage {
   protected $theme;
   
   public function __construct(Theme $theme) {
       $this->theme = $theme;
   }
   
   public function getContent() {
       return "Careers page in " . $this->theme->getColor();
   } 
}
```
And the separate theme hierarchy
```php
interface Theme {
    public function getColor();
}

class DarkTheme implements Theme {
    public function getColor() {
        return 'Dark Black';
    }
}
class LightTheme implements Theme {
    public function getColor() {
        return 'Off white';
    }
}
class AquaTheme implements Theme {
    public function getColor() {
        return 'Light blue';
    }
}
```
And both the hierarchies
```php
$darkTheme = new DarkTheme();

$about = new About($darkTheme);
$careers = new Careers($darkTheme);

echo $about->getContent(); // "About page in Dark Black";
echo $careers->getContent(); // "Careers page in Dark Black";
```

🌿 Composite
-----------------

真实世界例子
> Every organization is composed of employees. Each of the employees has same features i.e. has a salary, has some responsibilities, may or may not report to someone, may or may not have some subordinates etc.

白话
> Composite pattern lets clients to treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

维基百科
> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

**代码例子**

Taking our employees example from above. Here we have different employee types

```php

interface Employee {
    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary);
    public function getName() : string;
    public function setSalary(float $salary);
    public function getSalary() : float;
    public function getRoles()  : array;
}

class Developer implements Employee {

    protected $salary;
    protected $name;

    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getName() : string {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setSalary(float $salary) {
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getSalary() : float {
        return $this->salary;
    }

    public function getRoles() : array {
        return $this->roles;
    }
}

class Designer implements Employee {

    protected $salary;
    protected $name;

    public function __construct(string $name, float $salary) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getName() : string {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setSalary(float $salary) {
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function getSalary() : float {
        return $this->salary;
    }

    public function getRoles() : array {
        return $this->roles;
    }
}
```

Then we have an organization which consists of several different types of employees

```php
class Organization {
    
    protected $employees;

    public function addEmployee(Employee $employee) {
        $this->employees[] = $employee;
    }

    public function getNetSalaries() : float {
        $netSalary = 0;

        foreach ($this->employees as $employee) {
            $netSalary += $employee->getSalary();
        }

        return $netSalary;
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```php
// Prepare the employees
$john = new Developer('John Doe', 12000);
$jane = new Designer('Jane', 10000);

// Add them to organization
$organization = new Organization();
$organization->addEmployee($john);
$organization->addEmployee($jane);

echo "Net salaries: " . $organization->getNetSalaries(); // Net Salaries: 22000
```

☕ Decorator
-------------

真实世界例子

> Imagine you run a car service shop offering multiple services. Now how do you calculate the bill to be charged? You pick one service and dynamically keep adding to it the prices for the provided services till you get the final cost. Here each type of service is a decorator.

白话
> Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

维基百科
> In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.

**代码例子**

Lets take coffee for example. First of all we have a simple coffee implementing the coffee interface

```php
interface Coffee {
    public function getCost();
    public function getDescription();
}

class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {

    public function getCost() {
        return 10;
    }

    public function getDescription() {
        return 'Simple coffee';
    }
}
```
We want to make the code extensible to allow options to modify it if required. Lets make some add-ons (decorators)
```php
class MilkCoffee implements Coffee {
    
    protected $coffee;

    public function __construct(Coffee $coffee) {
        $this->coffee = $coffee;
    }

    public function getCost() {
        return $this->coffee->getCost() + 2;
    }

    public function getDescription() {
        return $this->coffee->getDescription() . ', milk';
    }
}

class WhipCoffee implements Coffee {

    protected $coffee;

    public function __construct(Coffee $coffee) {
        $this->coffee = $coffee;
    }

    public function getCost() {
        return $this->coffee->getCost() + 5;
    }

    public function getDescription() {
        return $this->coffee->getDescription() . ', whip';
    }
}

class VanillaCoffee implements Coffee {

    protected $coffee;

    public function __construct(Coffee $coffee) {
        $this->coffee = $coffee;
    }

    public function getCost() {
        return $this->coffee->getCost() + 3;
    }

    public function getDescription() {
        return $this->coffee->getDescription() . ', vanilla';
    }
}

```

Lets make a coffee now

```php
$someCoffee = new SimpleCoffee();
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 10
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee

$someCoffee = new MilkCoffee($someCoffee);
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 12
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk

$someCoffee = new WhipCoffee($someCoffee);
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 17
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk, whip

$someCoffee = new VanillaCoffee($someCoffee);
echo $someCoffee->getCost(); // 20
echo $someCoffee->getDescription(); // Simple Coffee, milk, whip, vanilla
```

📦 Facade
----------------

真实世界例子
> How do you turn on the computer? "Hit the power button" you say! That is what you believe because you are using a simple interface that computer provides on the outside, internally it has to do a lot of stuff to make it happen. This simple interface to the complex subsystem is a facade.

白话
> Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

维基百科
> A facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library.

**代码例子**
Taking our computer example from above. Here we have the computer class

```php
class Computer {

    public function getElectricShock() {
        echo "Ouch!";
    }

    public function makeSound() {
        echo "Beep beep!";
    }

    public function showLoadingScreen() {
        echo "Loading..";
    }

    public function bam() {
        echo "Ready to be used!";
    }

    public function closeEverything() {
        echo "Bup bup bup buzzzz!";
    }

    public function sooth() {
        echo "Zzzzz";
    }

    public function pullCurrent() {
        echo "Haaah!";
    }
}
```
Here we have the facade
```php
class ComputerFacade
{
    protected $computer;

    public function __construct(Computer $computer) {
        $this->computer = $computer;
    }

    public function turnOn() {
        $this->computer->getElectricShock();
        $this->computer->makeSound();
        $this->computer->showLoadingScreen();
        $this->computer->bam();
    }

    public function turnOff() {
        $this->computer->closeEverything();
        $this->computer->pullCurrent();
        $this->computer->sooth();
    }
}
```
Now to use the facade
```php
$computer = new ComputerFacade(new Computer());
$computer->turnOn(); // Ouch! Beep beep! Loading.. Ready to be used!
$computer->turnOff(); // Bup bup buzzz! Haah! Zzzzz
```

🍃 Flyweight
---------

真实世界例子
> Did you ever have fresh tea from some stall? They often make more than one cup that you demanded and save the rest for any other customer so to save the resources e.g. gas etc. Flyweight pattern is all about that i.e. sharing.

白话
> It is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.

维基百科
> In computer programming, flyweight is a software design pattern. A flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory.

**代码例子**
Translating our tea example from above. First of all we have tea types and tea maker

```php
// Anything that will be cached is flyweight. 
// Types of tea here will be flyweights.
class KarakTea {
}

// Acts as a factory and saves the tea
class TeaMaker {
    protected $availableTea = [];

    public function make($preference) {
        if (empty($this->availableTea[$preference])) {
            $this->availableTea[$preference] = new KarakTea();
        }

        return $this->availableTea[$preference];
    }
}
```

Then we have the `TeaShop` which takes orders and serves them

```php
class TeaShop {
    
    protected $orders;
    protected $teaMaker;

    public function __construct(TeaMaker $teaMaker) {
        $this->teaMaker = $teaMaker;
    }

    public function takeOrder(string $teaType, int $table) {
        $this->orders[$table] = $this->teaMaker->make($teaType);
    }

    public function serve() {
        foreach($this->orders as $table => $tea) {
            echo "Serving tea to table# " . $table;
        }
    }
}
```
And it can be used as below

```php
$teaMaker = new TeaMaker();
$shop = new TeaShop($teaMaker);

$shop->takeOrder('less sugar', 1);
$shop->takeOrder('more milk', 2);
$shop->takeOrder('without sugar', 5);

$shop->serve();
// Serving tea to table# 1
// Serving tea to table# 2
// Serving tea to table# 5
```

🎱 Proxy
-------------------
真实世界例子
> Have you ever used an access card to go through a door? There are multiple options to open that door i.e. it can be opened either using access card or by pressing a button that bypasses the security. The door's main functionality is to open but there is a proxy added on top of it to add some functionality. Let me better explain it using the code example below.

白话
> Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.

维基百科
> A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked.

**代码例子**
Taking our security door example from above. Firstly we have the door interface and an implementation of door

```php
interface Door {
    public function open();
    public function close();
}

class LabDoor implements Door {
    public function open() {
        echo "Opening lab door";
    }

    public function close() {
        echo "Closing the lab door";
    }
}
```
Then we have a proxy to secure any doors that we want
```php
class Security {
    protected $door;

    public function __construct(Door $door) {
        $this->door = $door;
    }

    public function open($password) {
        if ($this->authenticate($password)) {
            $this->door->open();
        } else {
        	echo "Big no! It ain't possible.";
        }
    }

    public function authenticate($password) {
        return $password === '$ecr@t';
    }

    public function close() {
        $this->door->close();
    }
}
```
And here is how it can be used
```php
$door = new Security(new LabDoor());
$door->open('invalid'); // Big no! It ain't possible.

$door->open('$ecr@t'); // Opening lab door
$door->close(); // Closing lab door
```
Yet another example would be some sort of data-mapper implementation. For example, I recently made an ODM (Object Data Mapper) for MongoDB using this pattern where I wrote a proxy around mongo classes while utilizing the magic method `__call()`. All the method calls were proxied to the original mongo class and result retrieved was returned as it is but in case of `find` or `findOne` data was mapped to the required class objects and the object was returned instead of `Cursor`.

Behavioral Design Patterns
==========================

白话
> It is concerned with assignment of responsibilities between the objects. What makes them different from structural patterns is they don't just specify the structure but also outline the patterns for message passing/communication between them. Or in other words, they assist in answering "How to run a behavior in software component?"

维基百科
> In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

🔗 Chain of Responsibility
-----------------------

真实世界例子
> For example, you have three payment methods (`A`, `B` and `C`) setup in your account; each having a different amount in it. `A` has 100 USD, `B` has 300 USD and `C` having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as `A` then `B` then `C`. You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD. Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account `A` will be checked if it can make the purchase, if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken. If not, request will move forward to account `B` checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler. Here `A`, `B` and `C` are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.

白话
> It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

维基百科
> In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.

**代码例子**

Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts

```php
abstract class Account {
    protected $successor;
    protected $balance;

    public function setNext(Account $account) {
        $this->successor = $account;
    }
    
    public function pay(float $amountToPay) {
        if ($this->canPay($amountToPay)) {
            echo sprintf('Paid %s using %s' . PHP_EOL, $amountToPay, get_called_class());
        } else if ($this->successor) {
            echo sprintf('Cannot pay using %s. Proceeding ..' . PHP_EOL, get_called_class());
            $this->successor->pay($amountToPay);
        } else {
            throw Exception('None of the accounts have enough balance');
        }
    }
    
    public function canPay($amount) : bool {
        return $this->balance >= $amount;
    }
}

class Bank extends Account {
    protected $balance;

    public function __construct(float $balance) {
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }
}

class Paypal extends Account {
    protected $balance;

    public function __construct(float $balance) {
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }
}

class Bitcoin extends Account {
    protected $balance;

    public function __construct(float $balance) {
        $this->balance = $balance;
    }
}
```

Now let's prepare the chain using the links defined above (i.e. Bank, Paypal, Bitcoin)

```php
// Let's prepare a chain like below
//      $bank->$paypal->$bitcoin
//
// First priority bank
//      If bank can't pay then paypal
//      If paypal can't pay then bit coin

$bank = new Bank(100);          // Bank with balance 100
$paypal = new Paypal(200);      // Paypal with balance 200
$bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300);    // Bitcoin with balance 300

$bank->setNext($paypal);
$paypal->setNext($bitcoin);

// Let's try to pay using the first priority i.e. bank
$bank->pay(259);

// Output will be
// ==============
// Cannot pay using bank. Proceeding ..
// Cannot pay using paypal. Proceeding ..: 
// Paid 259 using Bitcoin!
```

👮 Command
-------

真实世界例子
> A generic example would be you ordering a food at restaurant. You (i.e. `Client`) ask the waiter (i.e. `Invoker`) to bring some food (i.e. `Command`) and waiter simply forwards the request to Chef (i.e. `Receiver`) who has the knowledge of what and how to cook. 
> Another example would be you (i.e. `Client`) switching on (i.e. `Command`) the television (i.e. `Receiver`) using a remote control (`Invoker`).

白话
> Allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

维基百科
> In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters.

**代码例子**

First of all we have the receiver that has the implementation of every action that could be performed
```php
// Receiver
class Bulb {
    public function turnOn() {
        echo "Bulb has been lit";
    }
    
    public function turnOff() {
        echo "Darkness!";
    }
}
```
then we have an interface that each of the commands are going to implement and then we have a set of commands
```php
interface Command {
    public function execute();
    public function undo();
    public function redo();
}

// Command
class TurnOn implements Command {
    protected $bulb;
    
    public function __construct(Bulb $bulb) {
        $this->bulb = $bulb;
    }
    
    public function execute() {
        $this->bulb->turnOn();
    }
    
    public function undo() {
        $this->bulb->turnOff();
    }
    
    public function redo() {
        $this->execute();
    }
}

class TurnOff implements Command {
    protected $bulb;
    
    public function __construct(Bulb $bulb) {
        $this->bulb = $bulb;
    }
    
    public function execute() {
        $this->bulb->turnOff();
    }
    
    public function undo() {
        $this->bulb->turnOn();
    }
    
    public function redo() {
        $this->execute();
    }
}
```
Then we have an `Invoker` with whom the client will interact to process any commands
```php
// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
    
    public function submit(Command $command) {
        $command->execute();
    }
}
```
Finally let's see how we can use it in our client
```php
$bulb = new Bulb();

$turnOn = new TurnOn($bulb);
$turnOff = new TurnOff($bulb);

$remote = new RemoteControl();
$remote->submit($turnOn); // Bulb has been lit!
$remote->submit($turnOff); // Darkness!
```

Command pattern can also be used to implement a transaction based system. Where you keep maintaining the history of commands as soon as you execute them. If the final command is successfully executed, all good otherwise just iterate through the history and keep executing the `undo` on all the executed commands. 

➿ Iterator
--------

真实世界例子
> An old radio set will be a good example of iterator, where user could start at some channel and then use next or previous buttons to go through the respective channels. Or take an example of MP3 player or a TV set where you could press the next and previous buttons to go through the consecutive channels or in other words they all provide an interface to iterate through the respective channels, songs or radio stations.  

白话
> It presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

维基百科
> In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

**代码例子**
In PHP it is quite easy to implement using SPL (Standard PHP Library). Translating our radio stations example from above. First of all we have `RadioStation`

```php
class RadioStation {
    protected $frequency;

    public function __construct(float $frequency) {
        $this->frequency = $frequency;    
    }
    
    public function getFrequency() : float {
        return $this->frequency;
    }
}
```
Then we have our iterator

```php
use Countable;
use Iterator;

class StationList implements Countable, Iterator {
    /** @var RadioStation[] $stations */
    protected $stations = [];
    
    /** @var int $counter */
    protected $counter;
    
    public function addStation(RadioStation $station) {
        $this->stations[] = $station;
    }
    
    public function removeStation(RadioStation $toRemove) {
        $toRemoveFrequency = $toRemove->getFrequency();
        $this->stations = array_filter($this->stations, function (RadioStation $station) use ($toRemoveFrequency) {
            return $station->getFrequency() !== $toRemoveFrequency;
        });
    }
    
    public function count() : int {
        return count($this->stations);
    }
    
    public function current() : RadioStation {
        return $this->stations[$this->counter];
    }
    
    public function key() {
        return $this->counter;
    }
    
    public function next() {
        $this->counter++;
    }
    
    public function rewind() {
        $this->counter = 0;
    }
    
    public function valid(): bool
    {
        return isset($this->stations[$this->counter]);
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
$stationList = new StationList();

$stationList->addStation(new Station(89));
$stationList->addStation(new Station(101));
$stationList->addStation(new Station(102));
$stationList->addStation(new Station(103.2));

foreach($stationList as $station) {
    echo $station->getFrequency() . PHP_EOL;
}

$stationList->removeStation(new Station(89)); // Will remove station 89
```

👽 Mediator
========

真实世界例子
> A general example would be when you talk to someone on your mobile phone, there is a network provider sitting between you and them and your conversation goes through it instead of being directly sent. In this case network provider is mediator. 

白话
> Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation. 

维基百科
> In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

**代码例子**

Here is the simplest example of a chat room (i.e. mediator) with users (i.e. colleagues) sending messages to each other. 

First of all, we have the mediator i.e. the chat room 

```php
// Mediator
class ChatRoom implements ChatRoomMediator {
    public function showMessage(User $user, string $message) {
        $time = date('M d, y H:i');
        $sender = $user->getName();

        echo $time . '[' . $sender . ']:' . $message;
    }
}
```

Then we have our users i.e. colleagues
```php
class User {
    protected $name;
    protected $chatMediator;

    public function __construct(string $name, ChatRoomMediator $chatMediator) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->chatMediator = $chatMediator;
    }
    
    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }
    
    public function send($message) {
        $this->chatMediator->showMessage($this, $message);
    }
}
```
And the usage
```php
$mediator = new ChatRoom();

$john = new User('John Doe', $mediator);
$jane = new User('Jane Doe', $mediator);

$john->send('Hi there!');
$jane->send('Hey!');

// Output will be
// Feb 14, 10:58 [John]: Hi there!
// Feb 14, 10:58 [Jane]: Hey!
```

💾 Memento
-------
真实世界例子
> Take the example of calculator (i.e. originator), where whenever you perform some calculation the last calculation is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons (i.e. caretaker). 

白话
> Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.

维基百科
> The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

Usually useful when you need to provide some sort of undo functionality.

**代码例子**

Lets take an example of text editor which keeps saving the state from time to time and that you can restore if you want.

First of all we have our memento object that will be able to hold the editor state

```php
class EditorMemento {
    protected $content;
    
    public function __construct(string $content) {
        $this->content = $content;
    }
    
    public function getContent() {
        return $this->content;
    }
}
```

Then we have our editor i.e. originator that is going to use memento object

```php
class Editor {
    protected $content = '';
    
    public function type(string $words) {
        $this->content = $this->content . ' ' . $words;
    }
    
    public function getContent() {
        return $this->content;
    }
    
    public function save() {
        return new EditorMemento($this->content);
    }
    
    public function restore(EditorMemento $memento) {
        $this->content = $memento->getContent();
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as 

```php
$editor = new Editor();

// Type some stuff
$editor->type('This is the first sentence.');
$editor->type('This is second.');

// Save the state to restore to : This is the first sentence. This is second.
$saved = $editor->save();

// Type some more
$editor->type('And this is third.');

// Output: Content before Saving
echo $editor->getContent(); // This is the first sentence. This is second. And this is third.

// Restoring to last saved state
$editor->restore($saved);

$editor->getContent(); // This is the first sentence. This is second.
```

😎 Observer
--------
真实世界例子
> A good example would be the job seekers where they subscribe to some job posting site and they are notified whenever there is a matching job opportunity.   

白话
> Defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

维基百科
> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

**代码例子**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have job seekers that need to be notified for a job posting
```php
class JobPost {
    protected $title;
    
    public function __construct(string $title) {
        $this->title = $title;
    }
    
    public function getTitle() {
        return $this->title;
    }
}

class JobSeeker implements Observer {
    protected $name;

    public function __construct(string $name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    public function onJobPosted(JobPost $job) {
        // Do something with the job posting
        echo 'Hi ' . $this->name . '! New job posted: '. $job->getTitle();
    }
}
```
Then we have our job postings to which the job seekers will subscribe
```php
class JobPostings implements Observable {
    protected $observers = [];
    
    protected function notify(JobPost $jobPosting) {
        foreach ($this->observers as $observer) {
            $observer->onJobPosted($jobPosting);
        }
    }
    
    public function attach(Observer $observer) {
        $this->observers[] = $observer;
    }
    
    public function addJob(JobPost $jobPosting) {
        $this->notify($jobPosting);
    }
}
```
Then it can be used as
```php
// Create subscribers
$johnDoe = new JobSeeker('John Doe');
$janeDoe = new JobSeeker('Jane Doe');
$kaneDoe = new JobSeeker('Kane Doe');

// Create publisher and attach subscribers
$jobPostings = new JobPostings();
$jobPostings->attach($johnDoe);
$jobPostings->attach($janeDoe);

// Add a new job and see if subscribers get notified
$jobPostings->addJob(new JobPost('Software Engineer'));

// Output
// Hi John Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
// Hi Jane Doe! New job posted: Software Engineer
```

🏃 Visitor
-------
真实世界例子
> Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.

白话
> Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
    
维基百科
> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

**代码例子**

Let's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using visitor pattern 

```php
// Visitee
interface Animal {
    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation);
}

// Visitor
interface AnimalOperation {
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey);
    public function visitLion(Lion $lion);
    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin);
}
```
Then we have our implementations for the animals
```php
class Monkey implements Animal {
    
    public function shout() {
        echo 'Ooh oo aa aa!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation) {
        $operation->visitMonkey($this);
    }
}

class Lion implements Animal {
    public function roar() {
        echo 'Roaaar!';
    }
    
    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation) {
        $operation->visitLion($this);
    }
}

class Dolphin implements Animal {
    public function speak() {
        echo 'Tuut tuttu tuutt!';
    }
    
    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation) {
        $operation->visitDolphin($this);
    }
}
```
Let's implement our visitor
```php
class Speak implements AnimalOperation {
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey) {
        $monkey->shout();
    }
    
    public function visitLion(Lion $lion) {
        $lion->roar();
    }
    
    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin) {
        $dolphin->speak();
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as
```php
$monkey = new Monkey();
$lion = new Lion();
$dolphin = new Dolphin();

$speak = new Speak();

$monkey->accept($speak);    // Ooh oo aa aa!    
$lion->accept($speak);      // Roaaar!
$dolphin->accept($speak);   // Tuut tutt tuutt!
```
We could have done this simply by having a inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.

```php
class Jump implements AnimalOperation {
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey) {
        echo 'Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!';
    }
    
    public function visitLion(Lion $lion) {
        echo 'Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!';
    }
    
    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin) {
        echo 'Walked on water a little and disappeared';
    }
}
```
And for the usage
```php
$jump = new Jump();

$monkey->accept($speak);   // Ooh oo aa aa!
$monkey->accept($jump);    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!

$lion->accept($speak);     // Roaaar!
$lion->accept($jump);      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground! 

$dolphin->accept($speak);  // Tuut tutt tuutt! 
$dolphin->accept($jump);   // Walked on water a little and disappeared
```

💡 Strategy
--------

真实世界例子
> Consider the example of sorting, we implemented bubble sort but the data started to grow and bubble sort started getting very slow. In order to tackle this we implemented Quick sort. But now although the quick sort algorithm was doing better for large datasets, it was very slow for smaller datasets. In order to handle this we implemented a strategy where for small datasets, bubble sort will be used and for larger, quick sort.

白话
> Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation.

维基百科
> In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime.
 
**代码例子**

Translating our example from above. First of all we have our strategy interface and different strategy implementations

```php
interface SortStrategy {
    public function sort(array $dataset) : array; 
}

class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
    public function sort(array $dataset) : array {
        echo "Sorting using bubble sort";
         
        // Do sorting
        return $dataset;
    }
} 

class QuickSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
    public function sort(array $dataset) : array {
        echo "Sorting using quick sort";
        
        // Do sorting
        return $dataset;
    }
}
```
 
And then we have our client that is going to use any strategy
```php
class Sorter {
    protected $sorter;
    
    public function __construct(SortStrategy $sorter) {
        $this->sorter = $sorter;
    }
    
    public function sort(array $dataset) : array {
        return $this->sorter->sort($dataset);
    }
}
```
And it can be used as
```php
$dataset = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8];

$sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSortStrategy());
$sorter->sort($dataset); // Output : Sorting using bubble sort

$sorter = new Sorter(new QuickSortStrategy());
$sorter->sort($dataset); // Output : Sorting using quick sort
```

💢 State
-----
真实世界例子
> Imagine you are using some drawing application, you choose the paint brush to draw. Now the brush changes its behavior based on the selected color i.e. if you have chosen red color it will draw in red, if blue then it will be in blue etc.  

白话
> It lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.

维基百科
> The state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With the state pattern, a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass.
> The state pattern can be interpreted as a strategy pattern which is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.

**代码例子**

让我们以编辑器作为例子，它能让你改变文本的状态，比如比选择了加粗，它开始以加粗字体书写，如果选择倾斜，就以倾斜字体等等。

首先，我们有状态接口和一些状态实现

```php
interface WritingState {
    public function write(string $words);
}

class UpperCase implements WritingState {
    public function write(string $words) {
        echo strtoupper($words); 
    }
} 

class LowerCase implements WritingState {
    public function write(string $words) {
        echo strtolower($words); 
    }
}

class Default implements WritingState {
    public function write(string $words) {
        echo $words;
    }
}
```
Then we have our editor
```php
class TextEditor {
    protected $state;
    
    public function __construct(WritingState $state) {
        $this->state = $state;
    }
    
    public function setState(WritingState $state) {
        $this->state = $state;
    }
    
    public function type(string $words) {
        $this->state->write($words);
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as
```php
$editor = new TextEditor(new Default());

$editor->type('First line');

$editor->setState(new UpperCaseState());

$editor->type('Second line');
$editor->type('Third line');

$editor->setState(new LowerCaseState());

$editor->type('Fourth line');
$editor->type('Fifth line');

// Output:
// First line
// SECOND LINE
// THIRD LINE
// fourth line
// fifth line
```

📒 Template Method
---------------

真实世界例子
> Suppose we are getting some house built. The steps for building might look like 
> - Prepare the base of house
> - Build the walls
> - Add roof
> - Add other floors
> The order of these steps could never be changed i.e. you can't build the roof before building the walls etc but each of the steps could be modified for example walls can be made of wood or polyester or stone.
  
白话
> Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.
 
维基百科
> In software engineering, the template method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets one redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

**代码例子**

Imagine we have a build tool that helps us test, lint, build, generate build reports (i.e. code coverage reports, linting report etc) and deploy our app on the test server.

First of all we have our base class that specifies the skeleton for the build algorithm
```php
abstract class Builder {
    
    // Template method 
    public final function build() {
        $this->test();
        $this->lint();
        $this->assemble();
        $this->deploy();
    }
    
    public abstract function test();
    public abstract function lint();
    public abstract function assemble();
    public abstract function deploy();
}
```

Then we can have our implementations

```php
class AndroidBuilder extends Builder {
    public function test() {
        echo 'Running android tests';
    }
    
    public function lint() {
        echo 'Linting the android code';
    }
    
    public function assemble() {
        echo 'Assembling the android build';
    }
    
    public function deploy() {
        echo 'Deploying android build to server';
    }
}

class IosBuilder extends Builder {
    public function test() {
        echo 'Running ios tests';
    }
    
    public function lint() {
        echo 'Linting the ios code';
    }
    
    public function assemble() {
        echo 'Assembling the ios build';
    }
    
    public function deploy() {
        echo 'Deploying ios build to server';
    }
}
```
And then it can be used as

```php
$androidBuilder = new AndroidBuilder();
$androidBuilder->build();

// Output:
// Running android tests
// Linting the android code
// Assembling the android build
// Deploying android build to server

$iosBuilder = new IosBuilder();
$iosBuilder->build();

// Output:
// Running ios tests
// Linting the ios code
// Assembling the ios build
// Deploying ios build to server
```

## 🚦 Wrap Up Folks

And that about wraps it up. I will continue to improve this, so you might want to watch/star this repository to revisit. Also, I have plans on writing the same about the architectural patterns, stay tuned for it.
